Hi there! 😁

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [S4T](https://s4t.health/), where we develop new tools for increasing the effiency and efficacy of clinical trials 🏥. I have also worked for: 
- [Instituto Tecnológico de Informática](https://www.iti.es/) as a Data Scientist, working on a handful of applied AI and ML projects with focus on healthcare 👩‍⚕️, legaltech 🧑‍⚖️ and industry 4.0 👨‍🔧
- [Exponentia](https://exponentiateam.com/) as an independent consultant in AI 🤖
- [Alcanzia Energia](https://alcanzia.es) as a Data Scientist, forecasting energy demand and prices ⚡️
- [Solver](https://iasolver.es/) as an intern and later as a Junior Machine Learning Engineer 👨🏻‍💻

I'm from the beautiful city of Valencia, Spain 🇪🇸, where I currently live. I studied 🎓 Computer Science at the [Universitat Politècnica de València](https://www.upv.es/), with focus on AI.

As you might guessed, I'm really into AI/ML/DL. I enjoy reading new papers on arXiv 📚, experimenting writing new code 🖥 and learning new things in general 🧠. I'm also interested in the intersection of AI and code testing, where I've have given a talk 🎙: [Testing for ML models](https://youtu.be/DDXP7GXK4zU?t=8950).

On the fun side, I spend a lot of time playing Magic: The Gathering 🃏 and TTRPGs 🐉. I also do a lot of amateur weightlifting 🏋️‍♂️ (220DL/180BS/155BP).
